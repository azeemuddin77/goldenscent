Task Estimation
Before starting (3.5hours total):
Building the UI and making it responsive - 2hrs
Making the Vue cli ready and importing axios and everything(1hour)
Integrating the template and deciding where to manage the state(1/2 hour)

Decisions made:
Api is called from the entry file App.Vue
Wanted to centralize the data so maintained in root component.
Perfumes component is created.
Individual perfumes are looped there.
